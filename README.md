Hi! I'm a software engineer and I make things (supposedly)

## Professional Projects

### For a SAAS Provider:

**Organisation Details Page** - A React-Redux-based single page application for allowing the business-related account information for the user. Effectively a rich webform with a few complex components (country autocompleter, SMS verification flow, a few asynchronous search autocompleters).

### For a Civil Engineering Firm:

**[Florin Report Generator](https://github.com/sisby-folk/florin)** - A fully data-driven (Workbook-independent) automated report generation system for Excel written in VBA. Report templates are created using the full freedom of excel forumulae and then generated into PDFs or tablular output in a hands-free process configured using the GUI. Includes options for showing specific sheets, hiding specific rows, applying AutoFit, automatically inserting photos of a given filename, and automatically duplicating sheets to appear as multiple different pages in the output. Configurations are saved into the workbook itself using a bespoke key-value database implemented with named ranges and custom properties. Full logging + debugging support.

**[Sovereign VBA Library](https://github.com/sisby-folk/sovereign)** - A \~3200 line VBA library that improves the usability of both base VB6 - improving interactions with collections, null-checking, string manipulation, and returning meaningful information from subs - and VBA with VBA-Excel and VBA-Word - including utilities such a way to specify and validate the size and shape of ranges, a refeditor that provides user feedback on the shape and validity of the range, and a range editor that supports ranges spanning multiple sheets.

**[Silver, Report Writer's Assistant](https://github.com/HestiMae/silver)** - A data-driven data manipulation add-in for Word using the Office.JS API. Written in node, silver utilizes [SheetJS](https://github.com/SheetJS/sheetjs) to parse CSV and XLSX files and extract useful data, which can then be output into the fields of a word template, as well as in readable HTML cards to assist in the filling and writing of reports. Configuration for critical fields is performed entirely through JSON.

## In my own time

### Modding the game *Minecraft* in Java
*Most of these projects are implemented using [Mixin](https://github.com/SpongePowered/Mixin), a flexible trait and bytecode-weaving framework for Java.*<br/>
*All of these projects are open-source - licensed as LGPLv3, as is standard for GPL minecraft mods.*

**[Surveyor](https://github.com/sisby-folk/surveyor)** - A heavy-duty framework for creating world-map and minimap mods. Scans the world as it generates, taking a thin slice for displaying on top-down maps and compressing it into a very small format still suitable for any map mod. Uniquely, allows map data to be generated completely on the client - and uses this to enable map sharing & client data if it's ever missing, thanks to an extensive system for tracking individual player exploration of the world.

**[Switchy](https://github.com/sisby-folk/switchy)** - An addon-driven modular player profiles mod that leverages the existing ecosystem of established mods for player customizations (nicknames, skin swapping, player accessories, RPG classes, etc) to enable anything from outfit swapping to multi-character RPG-like gameplay with completely seperate inventories, locations, etc - customizable on a per-player level.

[Scrapped Games](/scrapped-games) - A small, sourceless collection of jam-style games made a long time ago in VB.Net, Java, and C++
