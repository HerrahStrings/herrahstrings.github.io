## In my own time

### Modding the game *Minecraft* in Java
**Minecraft** is a real-time multiplayer 3D video game, meaning all systems are heavily event-driven, and mods (implemented in the trait and bytecode-weaving framework [Mixin](https://github.com/SpongePowered/Mixin)) require both client-server networking implementations and a focus on performance.

*These projects are open-source - licensed as LGPLv3, as is standard for GPL minecraft mods.*

| **[Surveyor Map Framework](https://github.com/sisby-folk/surveyor)** | A heavy-duty framework for creating world-map and minimap mods. |
