# Me

Hi! I'm a software engineer and I make things. (supposedly)

I like crowd-built open source projects, tile and voxel-based games, and the beauty of good, well-documented automation.

## Professional Projects

**Florin Report Generator** - A fully data-driven (Workbook-independent) automated report generation system for Excel written in VBA. Report templates are created using the full freedom of excel forumulae and then generated into PDFs or tablular output in a hands-free process configured using the GUI. Includes options for showing specific sheets, hiding specific rows, applying AutoFit, automatically inserting photos of a given filename, and automatically duplicating sheets to appear as multiple different pages in the output. Configurations are saved into the workbook itself using a bespoke key-value database implemented with named ranges and custom properties. Full logging + debugging support.

**Sovereign VBA Library** - A \~3200 line VBA library that improves the usability of both base VB6 - improving interactions with collections, null-checking, string manipulation, and returning meaningful information from subs - and VBA with VBA-Excel and VBA-Word - including utilities such a way to specify and validate the size and shape of ranges, a refeditor that provides user feedback on the shape and validity of the range, and a range editor that supports ranges spanning multiple sheets.

**Silver, Report Writer's Assistant** - A data-driven data manipulation add-in for Word using the Office.JS API. Written in node, silver utilizes [SheetJS](https://github.com/SheetJS/sheetjs) to parse CSV and XLSX files and extract useful data, which can then be output into the fields of a word template, as well as in readable HTML cards to assist in the filling and writing of reports. Configuration for critical fields is performed entirely through JSON.

### Toys and minor projects

[**HerrahStrings/Scrapped-Games**](./scrapped-games) - A small, sourceless collection of jam-style games made uni and high school, in VB.Net, Java, and C++

### Hobbyist trinkets

[**HerrahStrings/Packwiz-Packs**](./packwiz-packs) - A collection of modpacks for modern [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net) written using [comp500/packwiz](https://github.com/comp500/packwiz)
